# 📊 Web Funnel Analysis: Page Visit Behavior

This project presents a funnel visualization of page visits across a user journey on a website. The goal is to identify drop-off points, conversion patterns, and optimization opportunities based on web traffic flow.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Analyze page visit behavior and represent it visually as a funnel to detect where users drop off during navigation.
- **Output:** Interactive funnel chart (HTML) displaying the transition of users through each stage.
- **Format:** This is a browser-viewable `.html` file exported from a Jupyter Notebook using Plotly.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Tracks the number of users reaching each page/stage.
- Highlights significant drop-offs (e.g., between homepage and cart page).
- Allows for dynamic interaction: hover to see counts, compare stages.

## 🧠 Interpretation Guide

Each bar in the funnel chart represents the number of users at a specific stage in the navigation journey. The decreasing width shows user attrition between pages. Use this to:

- Identify pages with the highest exit rates.
- Optimize content or UX in weak-performing steps.
- Improve conversion by addressing bottlenecks.

## 📈 Sample Use Cases

- E-commerce drop-off detection
- A/B testing landing pages
- Marketing campaign performance tracking

To view the interactive funnel:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `Page_Funnel_Visits.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Hover over the bars to see user counts and details.
